# Student-Grade-Management-System
This is a lightweight and efficient Student Grade Management System developed in C. It was designed to manage student records, including IDs, names, and academic grades, using fundamental programming concepts. This project represents my first milestone in C programming, focusing on structured data handling and memory management through arrays.
